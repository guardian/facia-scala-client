/**
 * Ideally, the whole of `facia-scala-client` would be independent of AWS SDK version - we'd _like_ consumers
 * of this library to be able to use whatever AWS SDK version they want, without us pulling in dependency on
 * either SDK version. For `facia-scala-client`, this is an attainable goal, as the only AWS API action it performs
 * is fetching from S3, and https://github.com/guardian/etag-caching provides the `S3ByteArrayFetching` abstraction
 * that encapsulates this action without tying to a specific AWS SDK version.
 *
 * Due to legacy code compatibility, we can't completely remove AWS SDK v1 from `fapi-client` for now, but
 * we _have_ removed it from `fapi-client-core`. This `SdkIndependenceTest` keeps us honest, and ensures we
 * don't accidentally re-add the dependency.
